        <img alt="" src="./img/placeholder.png" />
        <h3>Pike Place Market - 9:00am - 10:30am </h3>
        <p>Start you day off with a visit the the iconic pike place market. Head straight to the original Starbucks.
            Located
            at the northend of the market. Get your caffeine to fuel you up for your day.</p>
        <p>Wander through the market and visit various vendor stalls. As you make your way down towards the famous
            flying
            fish market. Grab some World Famous Mac & Cheese from Beechers small size is all you need (suppoesdly Oprah
            once
            stopped by an claimed it
            was the world best mac & cheese, recommeneded to get half spicy and half non-spicy off the request but they
            get
            it so often that they know what your asking for). Then Grab a dozen donuts from the daily dozen donut vendor
            stall located across from the flying fish vendor stall.</p>
        <p>Then wander down to the famously disgusting Gum Wall located outside and below the flying fish
            vendor.
        </p>


        <h3>Seattle Water Front - 11:00am - 12:00pm</h3>
        <p>From Pike Place Market continue walking down to the water front, it's a well marked walking path</p>
        <p>Visit some of the eclectic shops along the water front. The shop to to be missed is the Ye'old Curiosity
            Shop.
            Look around while in the shop you will see interesting items every where you look</p>
        <p>Contiue walking along the water front and taking in the sights. If you have extra time why not take a ferry
            ride
            to bremerton and back. Its a great way to see Seattle from the water. </p>

        <h3>Space Needle - 1:00pm - 1:30pm</h3>
        <p>No trip is complete with a visit to the Space Needle. Built in ____ for the worlds fair. A true architectural
            gem. A building so iconic that you instantly know your in Seattle.</p>

        <img alt="Image description" src="./img/example.png" />
        <h3>Ramen 2:30pm - 3:30pm</h3>
        <p>A trip to Seattle is not complete with out a bowl of noodles. It probaly rained during your trip so now it
            time
            to warm up with a bowl of noodles</p>
        <p>My recommnedation is to get Ramen Noodles at Ooink - they have a few different kinds noodles but all are
            fantastic. If you need a close location head to ahn noodle a short walk from the space needle and get some
            fantastic Vietnames Pho Soup all are good but the combination has everything tell its your first time and
            you
            had recommendaiton, they will walk you through what to order.</p>
